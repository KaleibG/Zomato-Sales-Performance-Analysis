üß™ DATA PREPARATION SUMMARY
==============================

**Original Tables:**

**Steps Taken:**

   `Estimated Revenue = sales_qty * Avg Menu Price`
4. Cleaned data:
   - Converted `order_date` to date format
   - Ensured price and quantity fields were numeric
5. Created calculated measures and KPIs:
   - `Total Revenue`
   - `Total Orders`
   - `Total Quantity`
   - `Average Rating`
